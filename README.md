Designed the Schematic and PCB Layout for the FM Transmitter circuit in Eagle Software.

Reduced the size of PCB as much as possible with proper interconnections.

Used Double Side for componets for further reduction in size.

Attached the ppt for the detailed information about project and added Gerber files folder for the designs.
