# PCB Design for FM Transmitter

This project involves the design of both schematic and PCB layout for an FM Transmitter circuit using Eagle Software. The primary goals of this project were to create an efficient and compact PCB design with proper interconnections.

## Project Highlights:

- **Schematic Design:** The project initiates with the schematic design, meticulously planning the components and their connections to ensure the functionality of the FM Transmitter circuit.

- **Compact PCB Layout:** The PCB layout was a key focus, with the aim of reducing the size as much as possible while maintaining proper interconnections. This helps in optimizing the circuit for space-constrained applications.

- **Double-Sided PCB:** To further minimize the PCB size and enhance efficiency, double-sided PCBs were utilized for component placement.

- **Gerber Files:** For reference and manufacturing purposes, the project includes a Gerber files folder containing the design files necessary for PCB fabrication.
